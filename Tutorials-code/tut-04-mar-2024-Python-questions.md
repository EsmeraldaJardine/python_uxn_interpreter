# Python features used in the course

These are some less common features of Python that we will use in the course:

* Tuples
* Enums
* Objects
* Lambdas
* Maps
* Using functions as values

Also, but to be discussed later:

* Bit masking and bit shifting


## Exercise 

* Create a class with a number, a string and a boolean
The number is the length of the string; the boolean indicates if the string has been manipulated
* Populate a list with instances of this class
* Using a map and a lambda, convert this list to a list of tuples
* In the same way, remove the last character from every string and decrement the length field.
