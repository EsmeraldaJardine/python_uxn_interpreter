Python Interpreter Program for uxntal

This program is supposed to read uxntal files, interpret and run them.

Status Report: The program does not run. It reaches the first ADD instruction and raises an error at line 288, in executeInstr()
    
                            ***
    if arg[1]==2 and sz==1 and (instr != 'LDA' and instr!= 'STA'):
                            ***

up to this point the return stack looks like this:
[(17, 1), (269, 2), 1]
